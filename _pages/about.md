Kia ora! I am a postdoctoral researcher specialising in audio machine learning and bioacoustics based at Tilburg University, Netherlands. My research interests include active learning and uncertainty quantification for scaleable and data-efficient biodiversity monitoring.

My current project is [TABMON](https://www.nina.no/english/TABMON) where I am contributing to the development of a transnational biodiversity monitoring system with autonomous acoustic sensors from Norway to Spain.

I am the co-lead of the [Listening Lab](https://www.listeninglabnz.com/) a multidisciplinary research group developing computational bioacoustic tools for conservation in New Zealand. I completed my PhD in computer Science from the Unversity of Canterbury where I developed methods for detection of invasive species. I am especially interested in how computational tools can aid in the detection of rare, at-risk and invasive species.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
